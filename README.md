# 7 Top ReactJS Features Which Makes It Best For Development

Many technologies were available like Angular, Node, Meteor when Facebook introduced ReactJS, most developers were required to do a lot of coding. Developers working on other frameworks have the challenge of having to rewrite most of the codes even when crafting components that changed frequently. Developers wanted a framework which could easily break down complex components and reuse that code.

Today, ReactJS has become very popular because of its extra features like simplicity and flexibility. most of the people are even pointing it as the future of Web Development Services.

# What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a component-based javascript library which is used for building an interactive and dynamic user interface for websites and mobile applications specifically for developing single page applications where data reflects in real time. Currently, it is one of the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the market. It deals with View in the MVC(Model - View - Controller).

In React everything is components the complete homepage is divided into small parts which merged together to complete the view. The main ReactJS Feature is the Virtual-DOM where only one-way data binding is present wherein AngularJS two way data binding was there any changes to the view are also reflected in the data and vice versa but in reactjs Instead of updating the DOM directly React makes two copies of a Virtual DOM, the original and an updated version that reflects changes displayed in from the view. The two copies that are stored are then compared and when any changes occur react update view directly that's why it preferred for the real-time application.

Let’s take a look at some of the key ReactJS Features that makes it stand out from the others




# Declarative:

React creates very interactive and dynamic user interface for websites and mobile applications. Create simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more readable and easier to debug.

# Virtual DOM
In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object." A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, it creates a virtual copy of the original DOM. It's a one-way data binding hence manipulating the virtual DOM is quick rather than updating original DOM because nothing gets drawn onscreen.

# Event handling
React creates its own event system which is fully compatible with W3C object model. All browser’native events are wrapped by instances of Synthetic Event. It provides a cross-browser interface to a native event. That means you do not need to worry about incompatible event names and fields. Besides, React event system is implemented through event delegation and also has a pool of event objects to reduce memory overhead.

# JSX
JSX can best be thought of as a markup syntax that very closely resembles HTML.It is more or less like the combination of Javascript + XML. JSX makes writing React components, the building blocks of React UI, easier by making the syntax developers use for generating these strings of HTML almost identical to the HTML they will inject into the web page.JSX is one of best ReactJS features. Web developers will always go for an easy way out, which is why this is a great choice for many.

# Performance
React uses one-way data binding with an application architecture called Flux controls.ReactJS helps us update the View for the user and, with Flux, can control the application workflow. Introducing virtual DOM adds advantages where it compares the new data with original DOM and automatically updates the view.

# React Native:
React Native is a custom renderer for React, just like React DOM on The Web. React Native uses native components instead of web components like React as building blocks. To begin with React Native, you need to know the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you know React, you still need to learn stuff specific to React Native, like the native components. React Native also gives access to the features these platforms offer, apart from transforming React code to work on iOS and Android.

# Component-Based
In React everything is component the web page divided into small components to create a view(or UIs). Every part of applications visuals would be wrapped inside a self-contained module known as a component. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.Components in ReactJS use to define the visuals and interactions in applications.

# Conclusion:
ReactJS Development uses new technology that has not been used before in web application development. It is a perfect tool to make high-performance presentation layer for your application. And it can be even faster if you take the advantage of immutable data structures. As ReactJS features like components allow you to develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

There are plenty of Flux implementations you can choose from, including the brand new framework Relay. The Virtual DOM feature which was not present in Angular adds an extra advantage. Having such great performing features framework like React.js is the dream of many Web Application Development Companies. So, if you are dealing with real-time data then ReactJS is the best solution.
